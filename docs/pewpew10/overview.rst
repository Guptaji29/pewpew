PewPew 10
=========

PewPew 10 is a standalone version of the PewPew device, designed specifically
to be cheap and simple to use in workshop settings. You only need two AAA
batteries and a micro-USB cable (with a computer to plug it into) to start
using it.

It sports a relatively large 32Ã—32mm display with square pixels and the
traditional six buttons, but it also has a connector header that can be used to
plug it into a breadboard for hobby electronics tinkering.

At the moment there is still work being done on this device, and it's not
available yet. More information will come as it becomes available.
